-- | Find /a/ minimal unsatisfiable subset of the input constraints.
-- 
-- The particular kinds of constraints are mostly irrelevant.  They
-- should however commute (order does not matter) and the solver must
-- be a pure function.
-- 
-- Given @N@ input constraints, the solver function will be called at
-- most @N * (N / 2)@ (@sum [1..N]@) times.
-- 
-- Returns:
-- 
--  * @M.empty <=>@ the input constraints are satisfiable.
-- 
--  * @s <=>@ the input constraints are unsatisfiable and @s@ is a
--    minimal unsatisfiable set.  I.e., removing any element of @s@
--    makes it satisfiable.
